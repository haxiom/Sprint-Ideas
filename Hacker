Hacker (title was spontaneously created)
Idea by: Sean Zellmer @lejeunerenard

Summary:
A web game that is hackable but playable. A source of playful hacker cred.

Proposed Features:
 - Restrained but creativity inducing hackablity (yes thats a word even if only in my little world)
 - Generic Objects

Description:
Inspired by this talk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6mkhptZ0gM
In the talk, the talker's game was hacked. I thought to myself, what if you made a game to be purposefully hacked? It would be an online game where players could roam around and create their own world by hacking.

I would like to allow extreme creativity in hacking but not allow some stupid kid to copy and paste a hack they found online. May this means that the game would have to be patched continuously to close hacking holes.
Players would use whatever tools they want to interact with the game. Console in Chrome, wget, or nmap. Anything.

Since there will be player created content in the world. They could "protect" their content with again a hack to prevent hacking.

Cons:
Definitely opens the server to attack. More invites it really.
